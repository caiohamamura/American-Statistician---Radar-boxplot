\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}
GAP: Visualizing classification multivariate data is difficult, relying on methods to reduce data dimensionality which may over simplify the problem and fail to represent the whole complexity of the dataset. 
Exemplos de como os dados são analisados hoje em dia.


\section{Methods}
\label{sec:meth}
The radar-boxplot is plotted using the radar plot design, along with the traditional boxplot concepts proposed by \hl{FISHER: procurar}. 

While the radar plot can display multivariate data, it fails to represent groups, instead it plots individual features, whereas boxplot represent the distribution of a group but for a single variable. Merging the two concepts, we can visualize the distribution of a group for multiple variables in a single plot. 

The concept is simple. We create a polar plot, dividing it by the number of variables we need to represent, each axis is a variable. Then, it is possible to represent the Q25-Q75 as a single radial polygon, with a varying width along each axis, whereas the Q0-Q25 and Q75-Q100 will be represented by two other radial polygons along the margins of the first Q25-Q75 polygon. The outliers as defined in the boxplot and the median can also be represented as dots and a circular line.

The polar plot is drawn as ranging from 0 to 1, from the center out. The variables must be standardized to range from 0.1 to 1 to be drawn in the same scale. It is important that the minimum value is not 0, otherwise it will be difficult to visualize low values as they will overlap each other.

\section{Results}
\label{sec:results}
